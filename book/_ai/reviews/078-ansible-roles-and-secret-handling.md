## Findings and scope
Reviewed complete role/defaults/template/playbook/Vault workflow; no_log plus diff=false, root-only target files, configuration-only runtime boundary, controller secret lookup, rotation overlap and vault-versus-database rotation. No material finding. Environment serialization is deliberately limited to suitable single-line values, and no real credential or running-service claim is made.

Severity: no unresolved material findings. Complete manuscript inspected for correctness, argument explanations, inline files/setup, prerequisites, Ubuntu/Fedora/RHEL scope, failure/recovery, readability, repetition, exercise guidance and cross-reference purpose.

## Independent primary-source checks
Ansible encrypted-content usage and logging references independently inspected: vault identity prompting and task-level no_log limitations agree with prose.

## Actual validation and limits
Ran tools/check_book.py --chapters 74-79: shell syntax9, Python syntax2, YAML parsing7, local links; no errors/warnings. This checks syntax/parsing and links only. No Terraform/OpenTofu/Ansible/Vault/cloud-init runtime, HCL semantic test, SSH target, systemd mutation, account, provider, cloud or teardown execution by reviewer. The manuscript states these integration limits explicitly.

## Editorial delta recheck — 2026-10-01

Verified exact prior body hash by reconstituting only the removed trailing sentence about pending review. No other prose/example delta. Approval retained and reviewed hash refreshed for the publication cleanup.
